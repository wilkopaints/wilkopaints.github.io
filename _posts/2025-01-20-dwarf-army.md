I went to a small Old World Tournament in January and it spurred me to finish 2,000 pts of Dwarfen Mountain Holds. I really enjoy [this Zhufbar scheme](https://tinkertailorsoldiersponge.com/blog/zhufbar-dwarfs) I worked out based on some of the older army books.

Added to the rest of the models painted last year I am quite happy with the overall army!
